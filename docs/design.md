# kloom design

Decisions from the founding brainstorm (2026-09-26). Change them freely, but
change this file in the same PR.

## What it is

A web page with the feel of the [inspiration video](https://x.com/IterIntellectus/status/2103212539895017864)
where scrolling moves a cursor along a timeline, plus a reading pane you can
dive into and an AI pane that grows the content. The part that brings a
reader back is the reading and the ability to add more; the visuals are the
hook.

## Visual language (from the video)

- **Palette tracks the era.** Dark night + gold for the mythic and modern
  bookends; parchment + engineering line drawings for the long middle. The
  palette is a property of each frame and transitions as the cursor moves.
- **Scene grammar.** A huge serif headline, usually in a collective "we"
  voice, with one accent word in red or gold ("BACK.", "VIRAL.", "WORK.",
  "LIFE."); one line illustration that draws itself on; small monospace
  metadata; optionally a big counter.
- **Persistent HUD.** Corner brackets; chapter label top-left; index
  top-right; position label bottom-left ("AD 1429"); counter bottom-right; a
  thin timeline bar along the bottom with a red cursor. In kloom that cursor
  is real: it is where you are on the spine.

## Layout

Three panes: **spine scroller** (left), **narrative** (right), **AI** (bottom).
A collapsible left nav may come later, once trails give it something to list.

## Content model

Engine-level and subject-agnostic from the start — the Cutler rule: the only
way to build a portable OS is to build it on multiple platforms from the
start. The second subject (AI) will not be a clean timeline, so time is not
baked into the engine.

- **Spine** — an ordered list of frames. The scroller walks it.
- **Segment** — a contiguous run of a spine with its own _label kind_. Western
  Civ is all dates; an AI subject might be dates until ~2012, then
  technologies ("Transformers", "Diffusion", "RLHF"). The HUD's position label
  comes from the segment.
- **Frame** — two halves, one per pane:
  - _scene_: headline, accent word, illustration (SVG), palette, metadata,
    optional counter;
  - _reading_: markdown narrative, charts, images, and **sources** —
    required, because this is history written with an LLM.
- **Trail** — a small spine anchored to one frame of its parent.
- **Storage** — files in git, one directory per frame under
  `subjects/<subject>/`. The site builds from them; git is the history of how
  the subject grew, and its undo.
- **Files** (sprint 001) — `subjects/<subject>/` holds `subject.json` (title
  and named palettes: scheme, background, ink, muted, accent, line),
  `spine.json` (segments, each `{id, title, labelKind, frames: [ids]}`),
  `trails/<id>.json` (`{id, title, anchor, spine}`) and
  `frames/<id>/{frame.json, reading.md, *.svg}`. `frame.json` carries
  `position {label, sort?}`, `scene` and `sources`. Label kinds are `date`,
  `category` and `technology`; only `date` segments need a `sort` and must be
  non-decreasing. Every frame sits on exactly one spine, and a trail's
  anchor must be a main-spine frame. Validation collects every problem in one
  pass and the site refuses to serve an invalid subject. Reading markdown is
  rendered with raw HTML escaped. Links and images are kept only for http(s)
  or scheme-less URLs, judged after the entity and control-character
  normalisation a browser applies. An illustration is inlined (so it can
  draw itself on) behind a regex _tripwire_ for script, style, embeds, links
  and handlers. That is not a sanitiser, and grow must not write an
  illustration until a real allowlist sanitiser replaces it. Giving each
  path `pathLength="1"` lets the draw-on animation work.
- **Engine vs subject** — `engine/` code never names a subject;
  `subjects/<subject>/` holds content and theme. Extracting the framework later
  should be moving files, not untangling them.

## AI: ask vs grow

- **Ask** — a transient answer in the AI pane. A "keep this" action turns an
  answer into content. Asking never changes the story by itself.
- **Grow** — writes content:
  - (a) add frames to the main spine;
  - (b) create a trail anchored to a frame;
  - (c) both — a new frame with a trail.
- **Runtime** — a backend on the host runs headless `claude -p` with a
  content-writing skill; grow jobs are queued, async, and commit their files.
- **Provider interface** — every model call goes through one interface, so a
  Claude API adapter (or another provider) is an additive change, not a
  rewrite.

## Interaction

- **Scroll ownership.** The wheel over the spine pane moves along the spine;
  the wheel over the narrative scrolls the narrative. Never both — a good
  narrative is often longer than a screen.
- **Narrative sync is a setting.** Default (Ken's preference): manual — scroll
  the spine, then "Sync Narrative" when something is worth diving into.
  Alternative: the narrative follows the spine.
  The choice is remembered per browser.
- **One gesture, one frame.** Wheel deltas over the spine accumulate to a
  threshold, then a cooldown swallows the trackpad's inertia.
- **Keyboard first.** Left/Right move along the spine (Home/End jump to its
  ends); Up/Down scroll the narrative; S syncs the narrative; T enters the
  trail branching from the current frame and Esc leaves it; Tab moves into
  and out of the AI pane, and Esc anywhere in it returns to the spine. Keys
  typed into a text field stay there. Visible focus, ARIA
  roles, `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured. Accessibility is a requirement
  from sprint 001, not polish.
- **Trails.** Entering a trail swaps the scroller to it with a breadcrumb
  ("Main story > Printing press"); the parent spine shows a branch marker.

## Risks

- **Illustration quality** is the biggest one: Claude-drawn SVG varies. The
  POC hand-curates its frames to set the bar; the generating skill is written
  against them.
- **Accuracy**: sources are mandatory on every frame, and the grow skill must
  produce them.

## Start screen

Idea: the public-domain "Modern Loose Reed Power Loom" (Marsden) drawing
from Wikipedia's _Lancashire Loom_ article, background removed and re-inked
gold on black, in the manner of the video's opening frame.
