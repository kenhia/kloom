# kloom design

Decisions from the founding brainstorm (2026-09-26). Change them freely, but
change this file in the same PR.

## What it is

A web page with the feel of the [inspiration video](https://x.com/IterIntellectus/status/2103212539895017864)
where scrolling moves a cursor along a timeline, plus a reading pane you can
dive into and an AI pane that grows the content. The part that brings a
reader back is the reading and the ability to add more; the visuals are the
hook.

## Visual language (from the video)

- **Palette tracks the era.** Dark night + gold for the mythic and modern
  bookends; parchment + engineering line drawings for the long middle. The
  palette is a property of each frame and transitions as the cursor moves.
- **Scene grammar.** A huge serif headline, usually in a collective "we"
  voice, with one accent word in red or gold ("BACK.", "VIRAL.", "WORK.",
  "LIFE."); one line illustration that draws itself on; small monospace
  metadata; optionally a big counter.
- **Persistent HUD.** Corner brackets; chapter label top-left; index
  top-right; position label bottom-left ("AD 1429"); counter bottom-right; a
  thin timeline bar along the bottom with a red cursor. In kloom that cursor
  is real: it is where you are on the spine.

## Layout

Three panes: **spine scroller** (left), **narrative** (right), **AI** (bottom).
A collapsible left nav may come later, once trails give it something to list.

## Content model

Engine-level and subject-agnostic from the start — the Cutler rule: the only
way to build a portable OS is to build it on multiple platforms from the
start. The second subject (AI) will not be a clean timeline, so time is not
baked into the engine.

- **Spine** — an ordered list of frames. The scroller walks it.
- **Segment** — a contiguous run of a spine with its own *label kind*. Western
  Civ is all dates; an AI subject might be dates until ~2012, then
  technologies ("Transformers", "Diffusion", "RLHF"). The HUD's position label
  comes from the segment.
- **Frame** — two halves, one per pane:
  - *scene*: headline, accent word, illustration (SVG), palette, metadata,
    optional counter;
  - *reading*: markdown narrative, charts, images, and **sources** —
    required, because this is history written with an LLM.
- **Trail** — a small spine anchored to one frame of its parent.
- **Storage** — files in git, one directory per frame under
  `subjects/<subject>/`. The site builds from them; git is the history of how
  the subject grew, and its undo.
- **Engine vs subject** — `engine/` code never names a subject;
  `subjects/<subject>/` holds content and theme. Extracting the framework later
  should be moving files, not untangling them.

## AI: ask vs grow

- **Ask** — a transient answer in the AI pane. A "keep this" action turns an
  answer into content. Asking never changes the story by itself.
- **Grow** — writes content:
  - (a) add frames to the main spine;
  - (b) create a trail anchored to a frame;
  - (c) both — a new frame with a trail.
- **Runtime** — a backend on the host runs headless `claude -p` with a
  content-writing skill; grow jobs are queued, async, and commit their files.
- **Provider interface** — every model call goes through one interface, so a
  Claude API adapter (or another provider) is an additive change, not a
  rewrite.

## Interaction

- **Scroll ownership.** The wheel over the spine pane moves along the spine;
  the wheel over the narrative scrolls the narrative. Never both — a good
  narrative is often longer than a screen.
- **Narrative sync is a setting.** Default (Ken's preference): manual — scroll
  the spine, then "Sync Narrative" when something is worth diving into.
  Alternative: the narrative follows the spine.
- **Keyboard first.** Left/Right move along the spine; Up/Down scroll the
  narrative; Tab moves into and out of the AI pane. Visible focus, ARIA
  roles, `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured. Accessibility is a requirement
  from sprint 001, not polish.
- **Trails.** Entering a trail swaps the scroller to it with a breadcrumb
  ("Main story > Printing press"); the parent spine shows a branch marker.

## Risks

- **Illustration quality** is the biggest one: Claude-drawn SVG varies. The
  POC hand-curates its frames to set the bar; the generating skill is written
  against them.
- **Accuracy**: sources are mandatory on every frame, and the grow skill must
  produce them.

## Start screen

Idea: the public-domain "Modern Loose Reed Power Loom" (Marsden) drawing
from Wikipedia's *Lancashire Loom* article, background removed and re-inked
gold on black, in the manner of the video's opening frame.
